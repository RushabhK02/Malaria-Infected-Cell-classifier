Hi,
I have created a convolutional neural network for image classification.
The dataset I have selected for Malaria Infection Classifier is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
The convolutional neural network with the given configuration was able to achieve 95.16% accuracy and 95.73% validation accuracy.
Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to improve the accuracy further.
